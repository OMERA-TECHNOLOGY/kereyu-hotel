* **Room listings** with details (amenities, pricing, availability)
* **Booking capability or inquiry forms**
* A **gallery / media showcase** of rooms, dining, spa, and environs

## 3. Technologies & Architecture

The project is built using modern web tools and follows best practices:

* **TypeScript** as the primary language
* **Vite** as the build tool / dev server
* **Tailwind CSS** (or equivalent) for utility-first styling
* Component-based structure (e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, or framework you used)
* **Responsive breakpoints**, **lazy loading** images, and performance optimization
* **ESLint / Prettier** for linting and formatting
* Well-organized folder structure (e.g. `src/`, `public/`, `components/`)

Feel free to tweak according to your actual stack (React vs. Vue vs. Svelte, etc.).

## 4. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16+)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OMERA-TECHNOLOGY/kereyu-hotel.git
cd kereyu-hotel
npm install        # or yarn install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev        # or yarn dev
```

This starts a local dev server (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`), with hot reload.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build      # or yarn build
```

This outputs a production-optimized version (e.g. into a `dist/` folder).

### Deployment

You may deploy using static site hosts (Netlify, Vercel) or your preferred server environment. Ensure you point DNS or hosting config to the built files.

## 5. Directory Structure (Suggested)

```
kereyu-hotel/
├── public/              # static assets (images, favicon, etc.)
├── src/
│   ├── components/      # reusable UI components (header, footer, room card, etc.)
│   ├── pages/           # route-based pages (Home, Rooms, Contact, etc.)
│   ├── styles/          # global styles, Tailwind config, etc.
│   └── utils/            # utility functions, helpers, data services
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── README.md
```

You can adjust as necessary for your framework or project style.

## 6. Usage & Customization

* **Adding rooms**: Add entries (data or JSON) in your room data source and ensure components fetch and render them.
* **Updating images**: Place images into `public/` and reference them in room or gallery components.
* **Styling override**: You can customize Tailwind config (colors, fonts) or add custom CSS modules.
* **Booking integration**: Replace the inquiry form with backend API integration (e.g. REST, GraphQL) for live booking support.
